Title: Course overview
Template: 720

**This is the web page for HCIN-720 from Fall 2015.** The current 720
web page may be found [here](/720).

This class is about prototyping physical artifacts that are connected
to the Internet: allowing things sensed about the physical world to be
acted on in the cloud, and to allow things happening on the Internet
to be reflected in the physical world. The focus of the class is on
learning by doing.

##Completed Projects
Here are some projects completed by HCIN-720 students in Fall 2015.

##Inspirations
This class has been heavily inspired, and in some cases modeled on, a
number of classes taught at other universities:

- [CMSC838f: Tangible Interactive
	Computing](http://cmsc838f-s15.wikispaces.com)
	taught by [Jon Froehlich](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jonf/) at the University of Maryland.
- [CSCI7000: Physical
	Computing](https://trello.com/b/dserApBq/cu-physical-computing)
	taught by [Shaun Kane](http://shaunkane.info) at the University of
	Colorado Boulder.
- [CS294-84: Interactive Device
	Design](http://husk.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/cs294-84-fall14/index.php/Main_Page)
	taught by [Bjoern Hartmann](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/)
	at the University of California Berkeley.
- [INFO290-4: Tangible User
	Interfaces](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290-4/f08/index.html)
	taught by [Kimiko Ryokai](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kimiko/) and others 
	at the University of California Berkeley.
- [CSCI6609: Ubiquitous
	Computing](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~reilly/CSCI6609/) taught by [Derek
	Reilly](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~reilly) at Dalhousie University.


##Resources
- [How to ask questions (the smart
	way)](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#intro)

###Photon
- [Photon Guide](https://docs.particle.io/guide)
- [Photon Reference](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/)
	- Note particularly the docs about the function we talked about in class:
	[`Spark.function()`](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#spark-function-)

###Javascript
There are quite a few Javascript books available via the RIT Library.
Use [this search link](http://rit.summon.serialssolutions.com/?q=javascript&SID=libhs#!/search?ho=t&fvf=ContentType,Book%20%2F%20eBook,f|Library,Online,f&l=en&q=javascript&SID=libhs)
for a list of them.

A couple of books to look for, whether online, physically via the
library, or buying them yourself:

- JavaScript: The Good Parts
- Learning JavaScript Design Patterns (read it via the library or free
	online [here](http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/))
- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (free online)
- [Node: Up and Running](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001808/index.html)
(free online)

Other online resources:

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)---Answers to all of the
	programming questions. Ever.
- [MDN JavaScript
	Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)---The
	Mozilla Developer Network is generally very helpful and well-done.
- [Mastering node.js](http://visionmedia.github.io/masteringnode/)
- [Javascript for Java Developers](http://blog.jhades.org/javascript-for-java-developers/)

###Books about ubiquitous computing
These are books that might be interesting for you to look at in
connection with this class. Some of them I'll use material from, but
I will provide you with anything I want you to read. I have copies of
all of these that you can look at or potentially borrow if I'm not in
need of it for class.

			This book goes into detail about designing user experiences for

			book in class. If you'd like to have a look at it, let me know.

			This is the other book I would have used as a textbook. It's

			ethical and societal concerns and implications.

			Like many books by Bruce Sterling, this one is a little bit in

			up a lot of thoughtful ideas around what it might mean for
			devices to be Internet-enabled.
