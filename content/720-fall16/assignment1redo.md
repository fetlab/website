Title: Assignment 1 Revise & Resubmit
Template: 720

##What is it?
If you're not pleased with how you did on the first assignment, good
news! I'm willing to award you up to **full credit** for the assignment
if you go back and finish it up, getting everything working. The
deadline for this re-submission will be the same as for Assignment 2.

##What to do
Review the instructions for [Assignment 1](assignment1.html). Taking
into account the feedback you got, improve your first assignment. Put
your updated code into the _same_ GitHub repository.

You can use this new visualization code for your second assignment,
but you _must_ have a copy of it in the same repository as your first
assignment.

##I'm confused
