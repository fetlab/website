- [Instructables](http://instructables.com/)

##Photon
- [Photon Guide](https://docs.particle.io/guide)
- [Photon Reference](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/)
	- Note particularly the docs about the function we talked about in class:
	[`Spark.function()`](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#spark-function-)
- [Particle Community](https://community.particle.io/)

##Javascript
There are quite a few Javascript books available via the RIT Library.
Use [this search link](http://rit.summon.serialssolutions.com/?q=javascript&SID=libhs#!/search?ho=t&fvf=ContentType,Book%20%2F%20eBook,f|Library,Online,f&l=en&q=javascript&SID=libhs)
for a list of them.

A couple of books to look for, whether online, physically via the
library, or buying them yourself:

- JavaScript: The Good Parts
- Learning JavaScript Design Patterns (read it via the library or free
	online [here](http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/))
- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (free online)
- [Node: Up and Running](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001808/index.html)
(free online)
- [JavaScript reference for non-JavaScript
	programmers](https://gist.github.com/yig/8744917) ("This document is
	intended as a reference or introduction to JavaScript for someone
	familiar with a language like C/C++/Java or Python.")

###Other online resources:

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)---Answers to all of the
	programming questions. Ever.
- [MDN JavaScript
	Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)---The
	Mozilla Developer Network is generally very helpful and well-done.
- [Mastering node.js](http://visionmedia.github.io/masteringnode/)
- [Javascript for Java Developers](http://blog.jhades.org/javascript-for-java-developers/)
- [Javascript Best Practices](https://github.com/stevekwan/best-practices/blob/master/javascript/best-practices.md)
- [Learn Javascript Best Practices](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/javascript-best-practices-1/#Summary)

##Learning about electronics
- [Nicely illustrated guide using the water analogy for
	electricity](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~squier/Teaching/ComputerSystemsArchitecture/520-2013-CourseDocuments/Lec-1-electricityPrimer.pdf)
- Sparkfun is a great electronics supplier. They have some very nice
	resources for getting started with understanding hardware:
	- [What is Electricity?](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity)
	- [Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law](http://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law)
	- [What is a circuit?](http://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit)
	- [Metric Prefixes](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/metric-prefixes-and-si-units)
	- [How to Use a Breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard)
	- [How to Use a Multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter)
	- [Connector Basics](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connector-basics)
	- [Polarity](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/polarity)
	- [Series and Parallel Circuits](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/series-and-parallel-circuits)
	- [AC vs DC current](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/alternating-current-ac-vs-direct-current-dc)
- Sparkfun also has a nice-look set of [Photon
	projects](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-for-photon-experiment-guide/all).
- Adafruit also has many useful tutorials, especially under the
	[Arduino category](https://learn.adafruit.com/category/learn-arduino?guide_page=2)
	- Including a nice lesson about
	[LEDs](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-2-leds/leds)
- [Bildr](http://bildr.org) is a fantastic resource for doing lots of
	things with electronics and Arduinos. For example, they have a great
	tutorial on [hooking up a light
	sensor](http://bildr.org/2012/11/photoresistor-arduino/).
