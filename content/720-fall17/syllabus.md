##Description
There is an ongoing revolution in the world of computing: no longer
are personal screen-based devices (desktops, laptops, phone and
tablets) the only ones for which we must design. We are entering a new
age of computing, variously described as “ubiquitous computing,”
“pervasive computing,” “the Internet of Things,” “everyware,” and so
forth, in which the line between digital information and physical
object is becoming much less clear. In this course, we will explore
how to rapidly prototype and evaluate systems that combine hardware
and software.

##Format
The course will primary operate on the "flipped" model, with students
watching videos or otherwise performing independent learning outside
of the classroom, and working on homework and projects during class
time.

##Objective
Students will learn to design and prototype mixed hardware/software
wearable and IoT devices, gaining a basic knowledge of electronics,
microcontrollers, Javascript, laser cutting, 3D printing, 3D modeling,
and other prototyping skills.

##Materials
In lieu of a textbook, students will be required to purchase a
prototyping hardware kit.

##Course Policies
###Late Assignments
Assignments turned in within 24 hours of the due date and time will
lose 25% credit. For each additional 24 hours of lateness, an
additional 10% will be taken off.

###Attendance
Students are expected to attend each class session, and to arrive on
time. Students who miss class for any reason are responsible for
gathering information about what was missed, and alerting the
professor to how they will make up the in-class activities. No
non-class-related email, web surfing, texting, or phone use during
class.

###Academic Integrity
Students should be sure to review RIT's official policies concerning
academic integrity. **Violations of academic integrity (cheating, double
submission, or plagiarism) will result in a failing grade for the
<u>_entire course_</u>!** In particular, for this class, this means that if you
turn in material containing someone else’s work without giving proper
attribution, or if you copy entirely another’s work without doing
anything original yourself.

####Attribution
There will be a lot of creation in this course. For some of the work we
do, there will be resources you can find on the Internet. It’s okay to
use libraries, code samples, and help from online, but you **must give
proper attribution** to your sources! If you feel in doubt, err on the
side of giving too much attribution rather than too little.

To give attribution for code, add a comment in your code clearly
marking what you got from where, and include a list of sources in your
Readme file that you turn in with each assignment.

To give attribution for ideas, images, papers, or anything else,
include the source and a brief description of the material used in the
relevant place (e.g. in the Readme for code, in your presentation if
presenting, etc).

**Note that you should be doing most of the work yourself!** For example,
it’s okay to grab someone’s library to help you make a graph, but not
okay to grab someone else’s code that does an entire assignment
for you. Likewise, if you're having a hard time modeling some
particular component, you can borrow a part from someone else's model
(with attribution!) but you may not copy the entire model.

##Assignments and Grading

There are a bunch of mini-projects (i.e., homework) in the course.
There is also a final project. And there will also be extra credit. At
the time of this writing, I'm not sure how many homeworks there will
be, but I'm aiming for one per week until we get to the final project
phase, so about 12. Here's how the grades will break down:

- Homeworks: 60% of final grade
	- Each homwork will be weighted equally, so with 12 homeworks
		they'll be worth 5% of your final grade each. If we end up with
		fewer homeworks, then each will be worth a little more.
- Final project: 40% of final grade
- Extra credit: up to 5% on top of final grade

##RIT Gender-based Discrimination Policy
The following is RIT's official gender-based discrimination policy.
Please read it, but the summary is: don't be a jerk. Treat everyone
like they're reasonable, intelligent, hardworking human beings just
like you. **I take this super-seriously.**

RIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of
harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university
policies located on our governance website.  RIT’s policies require
faculty to share information about incidents of gender based
discrimination and harassment with RIT’s Title IX coordinator or
deputy coordinators, regardless whether the incidents are stated to
them in person or shared by students as part of their coursework. 

If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or
harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is
available from one of RIT’s confidential resources on campus (listed
