[TOC]

## Learning objectives
The goal of this assignment is for you to start integrating your
learning to conceive of and create a more open-ended project from
scratch. You'll be using the internet functionality of your Photon
(finally!) and your electronics and fabrication skills to make an
ambient display.

### Ambient displays
We discussed these in class, but as a refresher: an ambient display is
some kind of a display that exists on the periphery of your awareness.
Just as you have an idea of whether it's raining by the sound outside,
or when classes change by seeing people walking by, an ambient display
uses non-intrusive mechanisms to give you awareness of some kind of
digital information. See [Inspirations](#inspirations) and [Papers
about ambient displays](#papers-about-ambient-displays) below for some
examples.

## Groups
This is a group project! You will work in groups of two. I will assign
groups based on your input. What does this mean? You will, by the date
below (see [Deliverables](#deliverables)), send me a private Slack
message that contains:

- A list of the people in the class whom you particularly _want_ to
	work with, and reasons why.
- A list of the people in the class whom you particularly _do not_
	want to work with, and reasons why.
- Or, if there is nobody who you want to work with, and nobody who you
	don't want to work with, a message stating this.

I will form groups based your feedback. I will not discuss the reasons
for my decisions with you at all. You will never know why I formed the
groups I did.

See below under [Group requirements](#group-requirements) for more
information about working in teams.

## Deliverables
See the notes below for details on each deliverable, including how to
turn them in, as well as grading criteria.

1. A proposal for the assignment.
1. An in-class demo of an attractive ambient display that visualizes a
	 source of online information that is relevant to your life.
1. Documentation in the form of an
	 [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com) explaining how to
	 recreate your project.
1. A well-produced video approximately one minute in length
	 demonstrating your project.
1. Every Friday by 5pm, a brief personal report about your group.

## What to do
There are multiple steps for this assignment, with [deliverable
dates](#important-dates)!

### Goals
Your overall goal is to build an attractive ambient display that
visualizes a source of information relevant to your life. Let's break
that down; there are multiple parts here: attractive, ambient, display,
information, relevant.

#### Attractive
The display should be nice-looking. It should be like something that
you might have in your home.

While I know the laser cutter and 3D printers are really convenient,
what I _don't_ want to see is an unfinished box (etc) made on these. For
example, [this
box](https://www.makehaven.org/sites/default/files/20151127_225522.jpg)
is not attractive, [this
box](https://www.ponoko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tlc185-4.jpg)
is much better, and [this
box](https://cdn.instructables.com/FGU/VTB2/HMVJPIAK/FGUVTB2HMVJPIAK.RECT2100.jpg)
is really nice. Likewise, [these 3D-printed
crystals](https://www.thingiverse.com/make:400689) have a creative
shape but are not very nice looking; [this
box](https://www.thingiverse.com/make:400746) although simple, is much
nicer looking; and [these
turtles](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2238443) and this [soap
holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:404028) are well-designed
and attractive.

A _really good_ way to to make a nice-looking project is to
incorporate the display into some existing object. The [1979 Bang &
Olufsen Raspberry Pi Internet
Radio](http://www.instructables.com/id/1979-Bang-Olufsen-Raspberry-Pi-Internet-Radio/)
is a really nice example of this idea taken to an extreme.

The display should not be obviously digital. Using three LEDs that
light up to show different things is bad. Using a whole bunch of LEDs
that shine to light up a section of the wall in different, subtle
patterns with a nice color of light (for example) is much better.

#### Ambient
An ambient display does not directly display information. For example,
if you're interested in the exchange rates between Yen, Euros, and
Dollars, an ambient display would not show the values as numbers, but
perhaps as [water levels in a
fountain](http://www.koert.com/work/datafountain/). A user should be
able to _interpret_ the information, but it should be more abstract
than a direct display.

However, there _should_ be a clear mapping beween the information
and the display, such that you could explain it to someone and they
could understand it.

#### Display
The display doesn't have to be visual---it can be auditory, for
example, olfactory, touch-based, or some combination of the above.
Think about motion, state change, subtle sounds, water, etc. Be
creative!

#### Information
You should get information from some source on the internet. If you
want to make that source yourself by hooking up a sensor somewhere, go
for it! Otherwise, find something out there. Many, many services have
APIs that you can use for different things;
[ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/) has a huge API
directory you can browse through (though note that many of these are
not suitable for ambient information).

#### Relevant
Finally, the information should be somehow relevant to you and your
life. For example, I'm not going to be entirely convinced if you
create an ambient display that visualizes the traffic in central
London.

### Proposal
Your team needs to turn in a proposal for your project. It should be a
well-written document, in PDF format, 2--3 pages long, consisting of:

- Project title
- Project idea, including motivation
- What information you will visualize and how you will get it
- Plan of attack with weekly milestones, including equipment
	acquisition plans
- What hardware resources you need and how you plan to get them

### Check-ins
Each Thursday during class, each team will very briefly report on
their progress, including what they have done in the previous week,
any problems they've encountered, and what they plan to do for the
next week.

## Important dates

Date          | Deliverable
--------------|------------
**Fri** 11/3  | (2pm) Team member selection message to me
Thu 11/9      | Project proposal 
**Fri** 12/15 | (12:30pm) Final presentations, deliverables due

## Grading
This project is worth 40% of your final grade. That amount will be
divided as follows:

- Project proposal:
	- Contains the requested information **(8%)**
	- Is well-written, organized, and grammatical **(2%)**
- Build an attractive ambient display that visualizes a source of online
	information that is relevant to your life:
	- Is a working ambient display: **(25%)**
	- Is attractive: **(10%)**
		- Note: attractive is subjective, but I'm going to judge it. Consider
			using extra materials beyond 3D printing and laser cutting; using
			"finishing" techniques such as sanding and painting; using fabric;
			or encasing your project in a manufactured object.
	- Uses online information: **(8%)**
	- Is relevant to your life: **(2%)**
- There should be a clear mapping from the information to the
	visualization, such that you could explain the display to someone
	and they could understand it. **(7%)**
- The display should be nice looking/sounding/feeling and not
	obviously technological in nature. Ideally the output will happen in
	a creative, non-obvious way. For example, if it's based on light,
	showing a graph with LEDs is obvious (see **Inspirations**
	below). **(13%)**
	- Note this is different from "attractive" above.
- Your documentation **(10%)** should include:
	- A description of the display, including pictures,
	- what choices you made for the information to display and the way
		you displayed it,
	- source code and 3D/2D model files,
	- a short (~1m) video showing your display in operation
		- please ensure that you shoot your video in landscape orientation
		- please edit your video so it is interesting to watch
- Group participation
	- You turn in the required group report by 5pm every Friday **(5%)**
	- You have participated fully as part of your group **(10%)**

## Group requirements
Each person in the group **must do both technical and design work**.

While I recognize that there are a variety of strengths in different
areas, each student in the class has worked very hard to make progress
in understanding the skills we've learned, and I want to see evidence
of that progress from each person.

In order for me to be able to gauge this progress, at the end of each
week, by Friday at 5pm, each group member will send me a private Slack
message that lists the following:

- what you personally have done technically on the project during the
	preceding week;
- what design contributions you personally have made to the project
	during the preceding week;
- what your team mate (or mates) has done technically and design-wise
	on the project during the preceding week;
- and any problems you are having
	- with your team,
	- with your project,
	- technology,
	- anything else.

## Tips
### How to make good Instructables
I want your Instructable to be good! Here are some links to help; they
are all similarly named but have somewhat different information:

- [How to Make a Great Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-A-Great-Instructable-1/)
- Another [How to Make a Great Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-great-Instructable/)
- [How to Write an Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Write-an-Instructable-1/)

### How to use your Photon with the internet

Follow the instructions at Particle's [Connecting Your
Device](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/connect/photon/).
If you're at home, your wifi setup should (probably) be easy. If
you're in the lab (and you should be!) it will be more irritating.
First, you'll need to do the connection instructions with `particle
serial wifi`. Connect to the **RIT-Legacy** network (note that the
name is case-sensitive!). You won't be able to actually do anything,
though, until you register your Photon. Next, go back into [Listening
Mode](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/modes/#listening-mode)
and type `particle serial mac`. You'll get a MAC address (not related
to Macintosh). Copy this, then visit
[start.rit.edu/Computers](https://start.rit.edu/Computers) and click
on "Advanced Registration". Then paste in the MAC address and go
through the prompts. If it didn't work, let me know the error message
and the MAC address.

Now you should be ready to program. Remember to take out the
`SYSTEM_MODE(MANUAL)` line so your Photon can get on the internet.

You might want to test out some of Particle's [code
examples](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/examples/photon/).

Information on using the Photon itself with the internet can be found
in the [Firmware
documentation](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#cloud-functions);
generic information on communicating with the Particle Cloud via your computer
is in the [Cloud API
documentation](https://docs.particle.io/reference/api/). However, you
probably will want to use Javascript, so read about that in the
[Particle API for Javascript
docs](https://docs.particle.io/reference/javascript/). There are APIs
for other languages listes
[here](https://docs.particle.io/reference/community/), and you can
find others by Googling (e.g.,
[Python](https://github.com/youngsoul/PyParticleIO)).


## Inspirations
Here are some examples of projects I found on
[Instructables](http://instructables.com), with some comments. Note
that most of them are *not* ambient displays, but contain parts that I
think would be suitable for an ambient display, or otherwise
illustrate something I think is cool.

- [Ambient temperature
	tapestry](http://www.instructables.com/id/ambient-temperature-tapestry/):
	This is a pretty good example of what I would like to see out of a class
	project. It's nice looking and it shows useful information. It doesn't
	connect to the net, and I would like it better with some less-obvious
	lights.
- [Mechanical music
	box](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Programmable-Mechanical-Music-Box/):
	It's not an ambient display but could be one. I particularly like
	the warm appearance and how it uses mechanical parts to make sound
	rather than a speaker.
- [Vibrating
	mirror](http://www.instructables.com/id/Vibrating-Pixels-Mechanical-Mirror/):
	This mirror has nine little circles that can vibrate independently,
	distorting the image. This very neatly falls into the *enchanted
	object* paradigm.
- [NeoWeather](http://www.instructables.com/id/NeoWeather-Ambient-Weather-Indicator/):
	This project uses a ring of RGB LEDs to indicate various things,
	including the weather or package delivery status. I like its
	ability, but it would lose points for this assignment because it's
	very technological-looking and the output is pretty obvious---just
	LED lights.	
- [Lego Mets home run
	indicator](http://www.instructables.com/id/Twitter-Activated-Home-Run-Indicator/):
	When the Mets have a home run announced on Twitter, the apple pops
	up! This is only semi-ambient, as it's really a binary display. I'd
	like to see a version that somehow includes a subtle indication of
	current score.
- [Twitter mood
	light](http://www.instructables.com/id/Twitter-Mood-Light-The-Worlds-Mood-in-a-Box/):
	Indicates the current overall mood of Twitter via light. I'd like it
	even better if the display was less LED-ish looking.
- [Tweiger counter](http://www.instructables.com/id/the-tweiger-counter/):
	A "Twitter Geiger counter" which searches Twitter for particular
	words and makes a clicking sound, so you have an idea of the
	"density" of tweets on a particular subject. It also has a meter.
	This project would get an A.
