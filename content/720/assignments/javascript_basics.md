## Learning objectives
The goal of this assignment is to get a basic familiarity and comfort
with Javascript.

## Deliverables
The only deliverable is to, during class, log into the tutorial site
and show me proof that you've completed the required tutorials.

## What to do

This one is pretty simple: you'll use the
[freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com) website to learn HTML and
Javscript.

First, visit [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com) and create an
account. Then, click **Map** in the top-right corner. This is a list
of all of the possible lessons you can take. Scroll down to find the
required lessons.

Complete all of these lessons:

- HTML5 and CSS
- jQuery
- Basic JavaScript
- Object Oriented and Functional Programming

Note that the estimated completion time for these assignments is about
20 hours. This will likely vary considerably based on your experience
level. I recommend starting early!

If you get done early, I also recommend going through the **Responsive
Design with Bootstrap** lession.
