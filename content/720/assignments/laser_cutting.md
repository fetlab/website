## Learning objectives
The goal of this assignment is to learn about laser cutting: what the
laser cutter and and can't do, how to make designs for the laser
cutter, and how to safely operate it.

## Laser cutter warnings!

The most important rule is **never run the laser cutter unattended!
You could cause a fire!** This means be next to it, watching it. If
you have to leave, pause your cutting job or get someone else to watch
it for you.

Don't put anything into the laser cutter unless you're sure it's
safe to cut. Some materials (like PVC) can release chlorine gas,
which isn't safe and can harm the optics of the laser cutter; other
materials (like foam core) are extra flammable.

Don't try to etch the reflective surface of mirrors (the laser will
bounce off), but you can definitely flip them over and etch off the
reflective part from the back.

There are materials in the lab that are definitely safe to use:
cardboard, acyrlic, wood, paper.

## Deliverables
See the notes below for details on each deliverable, including how to
turn them in, as well as for grading criteria.

1. An **attractive design** for a **decorative object** that is **at
	 least 2.5D**, **uses at least two materials**, and is
	 **laser-cuttable**.
2. The object you designed **cut out** on the laser cutter and
	 **assembled**.
3. Several high-quality **photographs** of your finished object from
	 different angles.

### Design assignment
Your goal is to design something that you can laser cut that is cool
looking! The thing you design must adhere to the following
requirements.

- At least 2.5D: your design should involve multiple layers or bending
	so it's not just one single flat sheet of something.
- Combines at least two materials. Involve wood, cardboard, acrylic,
	fabric, paper, etc.
- Interesting and/or creative: don't turn in something that you spent
	10 minutes on. I'll be able to tell! Use your creativity---get
	inspired by objects online or in the world.

### Photographing

Take and turn in several high-quality photographs (not crooked, in
focus) illustrating your finished item.

## Turning in
You'll show your final output object in class on the due date. You
should turn in your design file (in the format of the program you made
it in, e.g. Illustrator .ai file) and your photographs via direct
message to me in Slack by 1:59 pm on the due date.

Please name your files `{{page.filename|rmext}}-<yourname>.<ext>`,
replacing `<yourname>` with your name and `<ext>` with your file
extension. For example, `{{page.filename|rmext}}-dan.jpg`. If you have
more than one file of a type, please add a number, as in
`{{page.filename|rmext}}-dan01.jpg`.

## Grading

See the [syllabus](/{{page.roots[0]}}/syllabus.html) for how much this
assignment contributes to your final grade. The grade for this
assignment is determined as follows:

- 2.5D+: your object is multiple layers or otherwise not just flat (40%)
- Decorative: your object is a decorative object that could 
	displayed in your home or the lab (20%)
- Creativity: design is interesting/creative (30%)
- Photos: photos are good-quality (10%)
