Title: Course overview
Template: 720

This class is about prototyping physical artifacts that are connected
to the Internet: allowing things sensed about the physical world to be
acted on in the cloud, and to allow things happening on the Internet
to be reflected in the physical world. The focus of the class is on
learning by doing.


##Inspirations
This class has been heavily inspired, and in some cases modeled on, a
number of classes taught at other universities:

- [CMSC838f: Tangible Interactive
	Computing](http://cmsc838f-s15.wikispaces.com)
	taught by [Jon Froehlich](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jonf/) at the University of Maryland.
- [CSCI7000: Physical
	Computing](https://trello.com/b/dserApBq/cu-physical-computing)
	taught by [Shaun Kane](http://shaunkane.info) at the University of
	Colorado Boulder.
- [CS294-84: Interactive Device
	Design](http://husk.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/cs294-84-fall14/index.php/Main_Page)
	taught by [Bjoern Hartmann](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/)
	at the University of California Berkeley.
- [INFO290-4: Tangible User
	Interfaces](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290-4/f08/index.html)
	taught by [Kimiko Ryokai](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kimiko/) and others 
	at the University of California Berkeley.
- [CSCI6609: Ubiquitous
	Computing](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~reilly/CSCI6609/) taught by [Derek
	Reilly](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~reilly) at Dalhousie University.

###Javascript
There are quite a few Javascript books available via the RIT Library.
Use [this search link](http://rit.summon.serialssolutions.com/?q=javascript&SID=libhs#!/search?ho=t&fvf=ContentType,Book%20%2F%20eBook,f|Library,Online,f&l=en&q=javascript&SID=libhs)
for a list of them.

A couple of books to look for, whether online, physically via the
library, or buying them yourself:

- JavaScript: The Good Parts
- Learning JavaScript Design Patterns (read it via the library or free
	online [here](http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/))
- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (free online)
- [Node: Up and Running](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001808/index.html)
(free online)
- [JavaScript reference for non-JavaScript
	programmers](https://gist.github.com/yig/8744917) ("This document is
	intended as a reference or introduction to JavaScript for someone
	familiar with a language like C/C++/Java or Python.")

Other online resources:

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)---Answers to all of the
	programming questions. Ever.
- [MDN JavaScript
	Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)---The
	Mozilla Developer Network is generally very helpful and well-done.
