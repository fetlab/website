Title: Individual Assignment 3
Template: 722

##Introduction
In this assignment, you will create paper prototypes to test out your
design changes for the application and tasks you tested in Assignment 2.
Your changes don't have to be exactly the same as you proposed in
that assignment, however.

Create a paper prototype for each of three design changes to the app
you analyzed in Assignment 2. Then, following the same protocol as in
Assignment 2, test out your changes with two users. Your participants
should _not_ be the same people as tested the app in Assignment two.

##Deliverables
Once you have collected your data, you will write a two page
report on what you observed. You will also give a five minute
presentation in class on the due date. For both, you should include
drawings or images to help the class understand what you observed.
You will turn in both your report and your slides via Slack on the due
date.

##Grading
This assignment is worth 7% of your final grade. Both your written
report **(4%)** and your in-class presentation **(3%)** should adhere
to the following criteria:

- Clear, easy to read, without grammar or spelling errors
- Clearly describes how the observation was conducted: when and
	where you went, what app you tested, what tasks you had the
	participant do.
- Clearly describes the participants: age, occupation, experience
	with mobile devices and apps; don't use a photograph or their real
	name, however.
- Describe your observations for each task: Were any tasks
	especially easy/difficult? What aspects of the tasks were slow,
	confusing, etc.? Note that if you donâ€™t have any interesting
	observations after your first participant, you may need to adjust
	your study tasks or your chosen app. Include pictures to
	illustrate your points.
- Includes interesting concrete examples, sketches/images where
	appropriate
- Describe three possible improvements that could be made to the
	user interface to avoid the problems the users had.
