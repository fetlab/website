##Course details

- Class meetings: Tuesdays and Thursdays 2:00--3:15 PM, GOL-1620
- Office hours: TBD
- Final exam period: Tuesday, May 17 12:30--2:30 PM, GOL-1620

##Course format
This is a seminar-style class. Students are expected to complete all
background reading before class, to make presentations, ask questions,
and offer their thoughts on topics being discussed. Students will
complete individual assignments and one group project.

##Course objectives
Students willâ€¦

- understand where and how mobile HCI differs from HCI;
- gain a foundation of contemporary and classic mobile HCI research;
- identify and understand current challenges in mobile HCI;
- learn to think beyond "brick" devices (e.g., phones, tables) to new
- interaction modalities;
- understand challenges in evaluating mobile interfaces.

##Course materials
The book for the course is _There's Not an App For That_ by Simon
Robinson, Matt Jones, and Gary Marsden. It is available via the campus
bookstore as well as in digital form from online retailers such as
Amazon.

We will read many papers in the course as well; most may be found on
the ACM Digital Library, IEEExplore, or via Google Scholar.

##Course policies
###Late assignments
Assignments turned in within 24 hours after the due date/time will be
worth 50% credit; for each subsequent 24 hours after the
deadline, an additional 10% will be subtracted.

###Attendance
Students are expected to attend each class session, and to arrive on
time. Students who miss class for any reason are responsible for
gathering information about what was missed, and alerting the
professor to how they will make up the in-class activities. No email,
web surfing, texting, or phone use during class. Your attendance will
impact your class participation grade.

###Attribution
During your project work, you may be coding.  For some of the work you
do, there will be resources you can find on the Internet. It's okay to
use libraries, code samples, and help from online, but **you must give
proper attribution** to your sources! If you feel in doubt, err on the
side of giving too much attribution rather than too little.

To give attribution for code, add a comment in your code clearly
marking what you got from where, and include a list of sources in your
Readme file that you turn in with each assignment.

To give attribution for ideas, images, papers, or anything else,
include the source and a brief description of the material used in the
relevant place (e.g. in the Readme for code, in your presentation if
presenting, etc).

###Academic integrity
Students should be sure to review RIT's official policies concerning
academic integrity. Violations of academic integrity (cheating, double
submission, or plagiarism) will result in a failing grade for **the
entire class**! In particular, for this class, this means that if you
turn in material containing someone else's work without giving proper
attribution, or if you copy entirely another's work without doing
anything original yourself.

Note in that I am _very_ unforgiving as regards academic integrity
violations. I _have_ failed students before for plagiarising work.

##Assignments and grading
###Reading summaries (9%)
We will read approximately three research papers each week. The papers
will be assigned the Tuesday of the preceding week. Students are
expected to read each paper each week and to turn in a brief summary
via Slack; these summaries are due by the start of the class in
which the paper will be discussed. See [Reading Summaries
Guidelines](summaries.html) for more information.

###Class presentation and discussion (20%)
Each student will teach one class, either presenting several papers
and leading discussion, or presenting a technology tutorial on a
relevant topic.  See [Paper Presentation
Guidelines](presentation_guidelines.html) for more information.

###Individual assignments (21%)
There will be three individual assignments throughout the course of
the class, each worth 7% of your final grade.

###Class participation (10%)
Much of the class will be discussion-based. There will also be
in-class activities. This grade reflects the amount of participation
during the class. Class participation means:

- Asking questions
- Responding to other students' questions
- Participating in discussion
- Participating in in-class activities

If I don't know who you are by halfway through the semester, you will
not get a good grade in this category.

###Project (40%)
Projects will be evaluated on several factors: the proposal, the
post-feedback updated proposal, the mid-project check-ins, and the
final presentation, paper, and deliverable (if applicable). See the
[Project Guidelines](project_guidelines.html) for more information.

###Extra credit (5%)
There may be extra credit, worth up to 5%.
