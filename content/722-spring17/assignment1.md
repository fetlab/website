Title: Individual Assignment 1
Template: 722

##Introduction
In this assignment, you will observe peoples' behavior around mobile
devices in a public place. Spend _at least_ two hours in observation.
You should note how people are using their mobile devices; for
example:

- What devices do they have?
- How are they carrying them?
- Do they seem to have any problems using them?
- What do they seem to be doing with the devices?
- Are they doing something else while using the device (walking, talking
	eating)? How do they handle this situation?

You might spend the first hour noting general patterns and finding
interesting ones, then the second hour watching a single pattern more
closely.

For this assignment, don't interact with the people you're
watching---simply observe them. Please don't take photos of people
during your observation, though you could take photos of the space
without identifying anyone. You could also recreate a mobile device
usage scenario you observed and photograph it.

##Deliverables
You will give a five minute presentation in class on the due date.
You should include drawings or images to help the class understand
what you observed (but without photographing specific people in
public, as noted above).

###Presentation guidelines
- Your presentation must take no more than five minutes---this time
	limit will be strictly enforced.
- You should rehearse your presentation several times before class.
- Your slides should balance text to help the audience understand your
	observations with interesting imagery.
- Do not read your slides to the class! This is one of the most common
	mistakes that novice presenters make.

##Grading
This assignment is worth 7% of your final grade. Your in-class
presentation will be graded according to the following criteria:

- Clear, easy to read, without grammar or spelling errors (1%).
- Clearly describes how the observation was conducted: when and
	where you went, how many people were there, what the environment
	was like, etc (1%).
- Clearly describes an interesting pattern of activity related to
	mobile device interaction, with specific examples (3%).
- Includes interesting concrete examples, sketches/images where
	appropriate (1%).
- Presentation style is appropriate: you have obviously practiced your
	material, your slides have a good balance of text and imagery, you
	aren't just reading the slides (1%).
