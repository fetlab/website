Title: Project Guidelines
Template: 722

##Description
There will be one project over the course of the semester. Projects
will be conducted by teams of 3--4 students. I will form teams for
you, based in part on student preferences, and in part on student
skill levels. I will expect each team member to do **both** technical
and design work! More details on team formation can be found
[here](team_formation.html).

The goal of the project is to understand how to think about and
perform research in one of the areas of the class. The project can be
study- or implementation-based.

##Choosing a project
The projects will be related to work that has been previously done in
the research community. Each student will look at papers from a number
of previous conferences, and eventually the group will choose a paper,
the research in which the team will replicate or extend. The rationale
for this mechanism is that in previous years, I've seen students
struggle with picking projects that are interesting, doable in the
course of a semester, and possible given the skill levels of the
students in the team.

There are two parts to choosing the project:

- an [individual part](project_individual.html), and
- a [group part](project_group.html).

##Grading
The project is worth a cumulative total of **47%** of your final
grade:

- [Individual effort](project_individual.html) **(12%)**
- [Group effort](project_group.html) **(20%)**
- [Group participation](project_group.html#team-participation-grading-criteria)
	**(15%)**
