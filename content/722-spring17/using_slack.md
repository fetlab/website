Title: Using Slack
Template: 722

Slack is a system that is like a combination of instant messaging,
email, and forums. We'll use Slack in the class for annoucements,
discussions, and getting help, and I'll post your grades and feedback
via private Slack messaging.

##Signing up
To get connected to Slack, visit
[http://hcin722-spring17.slack.com](http://hcin722-spring17.slack.com).
and sign up using your `rit.edu` email address. Do the following:

- Set your username to be something you like
- Set your name to be your actual name
- Set your profile photo to a picture of your face; doing so will help
	me remember who you are more quickly
- Check that your time zone is correct
- Post in `#introductions` the following:
	- Who you are
	- What program you are in (e.g., MS HCI)
	- Why you're taking this class
	- The coolest or most interesting mobile, wearable, or Internet of
		Things technology you've seen

##Notifications
Download one of the many [Slack apps](https://slack.com/apps) so that
you can stay caught up on what's happening in class. Remember that
this is the **only** way I will use to communicate with you, so installing
one of the phone apps is a _very_ good idea. More information about
getting Slack to notify you can be found on this [Slack support
page](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201895138-Understanding-Slack-notifications),
including setting up email notification.

##Channels
Slack is organized into "channels," which are topic-specifc areas.
I've set up a number of channels to start with, and may add some more
as the semester proceeds. Slack organizes channels alphabetically. At
the start of class, we have:

- **#general**: For general questions and discussions that don't fit
	into any of the other channels. I'll also post announcements,
	including new assignments, readings, and so on here.
- **#inspirations**: Post general inspirations and examples of
	Internet-enabled and wearable devices here.
- **#random**: For stuff unrelated or only somewhat related to class.
	Jokes, funny videos, etc. Be nice.

##Mentions
If you want to ensure that someone (such as me) sees your message, use
a mention. You do this like Twitter: use the `@` symbol with the
person's username. For example: `@dan I'm missing a wire from my kit.`
When you type the `@` symbol Slack will show you a list of people so
you don't have to remember usernames.

##Posts
Posts are mini-documents that live within Slack. They allow you
more-easily edit and format your thoughts, and many of your
assignments will be turned in via Posts. Please read how to [compose a
Post](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/203950418-Compose-a-post)
and how to [format your
Posts](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/209774578-Formatting-for-posts).

##Direct messages
You can do a direct chat with someone via the Direct Messages menu on
the left. This can be seen only by the two people involved in the
chat. So if you direct message another student, I will not be able to
see it. You can use direct messages to communicate with me regarding
confidential class matters such as grades. You will also turn in many
of your assignments by sharing a Post directly with me. If you have
questions which might benefit other students with the answers, please
post them to one of the public channels (and optionally use `@dan` to
get my attention).

##More help
The [Slack support site](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us) has many
articles on using Slack. Or you can post a question to **#general**.
