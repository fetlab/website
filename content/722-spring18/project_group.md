Title: Project Guidlines&mdash;Group Effort
Template: 722

This page describes the requirements for the **group effort**
portion of the [group project](project_guidelines.html). The
[individual effort](project_individual.html) part comes first.

[TOC]

##Grading
The group project grade (worth **20%** of your final grade) will be
comprised of the following components:

- Proposal **(3.5%)**
- Updated proposal **(1.5%)**
- Check in 1 **(2.5%)**
- Check in 2 **(2.5%)**
- Final deliverables **(10%)**
	- Final paper **(4%)**
	- Final presentation **(3%)**
	- Video **(3%)**

An additional 15% of your final grade will be assigned for group
participation as follows:

- Filling out group feedback **(5%)**
- Group participation **(10%)**

See each section below for individual grading criteria.

##Project proposal
Once your groups have been formed, you will use all of the papers and
summaries created by you and your team members in order to form a
project proposal. The proposal should be a well-written document
in PDF format, 2--3 pages long, consisting of:

- Project title
- Project idea, including motivation (this should be an expanded
	version of the summary of one of the papers)
- Planned contributions
- Plan of attack with weekly milestones (e.g., a rough plan of how you
	will accomplish the work)
- Skills needed to accomplish the project
- What hardware, software, or other resources you might need, and how
	you plan to get them
- Success criteria (How will you know if you succeed? I will grade you
	partially on whether you met your own criteria.)
- Group members and detailed roles, including who will contribute
	which skills (see "Skills" below)

If you are having a hard time with your proposal, please come to my
office hours, email me, or otherwise discuss it with me, **well in
advance of the due date**.

##Advice
Whether you are doing a study or an implementation, your goal is to
focus---focus on what you want to show or find out and the set of work
that will get you to that point. As you begin, you will have a
difficult time focusing, but I expect you to gain focus quickly. Part
of the way to get said focus is to read---read many, many research
papers related to your project. Don't just read the bare minimum
required for the class, but look at lots! You don't have to read
everything in-depth, but cultivate an understanding of the area in
which you want to do your project and find examples of what you think
are successful projects. Those papers will help you understand what
focus looks like for that kind of project.

###Skills
Ensure that the skillset of the group matches the needs of the
project. This is not the time to learn to program or to run a user
study if nobody in the group has ever done those things, or anything
close to them.

The detailed description of team member roles should reflect the
needed and available skills; e.g., not just "Jane will do the
programming and Fred will do the design", but "Jane did machine
learning in her internship with Google and will handle the gesture
recognition component of the project while Fred's experience in
HCIN-730 will allow him to design an ethnographic study."

###Projects involving hardware
For hardware projects, there are many possible components and
platforms to use. I recommend using something that is Arduino-based,
as there is a lot of support online for this platform. In particular,
the [Light Blue Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean/) is a newer
Arduino-compatible platform that supports Bluetooth Low Energy and has
a built-in batter, making it nice for wearable projects. Good
resources for hardware projects include
[SparkFun](http://sparkfun.com/), [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com), and
[SeeedStudio](http://seeedstudio.com/), as well as the Arduino
[website](http://arduino.cc) and [forums](http://forum.arduino.cc/).

If you want to do a project involving hardware, the lab has a
collection of hardware that's kept in the "cage". You can see a
mostly-current list [here](/720/parts.html). If I don't have the
needed parts, I will help you determine what you might need and where
to order it.

I also have some larger resources already available for loan: one
Oculus Rift DK1, one Pebble smartwatch, one Samsung Galaxy Gear 1
smartwatch, five Google Glass units, a Samsung Galaxy S3 phone, and a
Google Nexus phone.

You may also use the 3D printers and laser cutter in the lab, but you
need to have my permission and training first. (If you've taken
HCIN-720, you're set.)

###Projects involving software
For software projects, there are a number of ways to go. I personally
am a big fan of Python, which can use [Pygame](http://pygame.org) for
simple GUIs and [Qt](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide) for more
complex ones. On the Mac, both of these can be installed via
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh).  Another option is
[Kivy](http://kivy.org), which is a cross-platform Python framework
which will let you use Python to create both mobile and desktop apps.

Alternatively, using HTML and Javascript is a feasible approach.
[Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) will let you translate
applications written this way into mobile apps.

If you need an Apple developer account for this class, please let me
know ASAP and I will help you.

##Deliverables
There are several items due at various points through the course; see
the right sidebar for the dates. Each deliverable should be turned in
via Direct Message or file sharing to me on Slack. For all items, I
expect high-quality writing: check your spelling, avoid [passive
voice](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/539/01/), and
proofread (note writing resources on the [main page](index.html)).

<b style="color:red">Note that I will only accept PDF format for
documents you turn in!</b>

###Project proposal and presentation
See [above](#project-proposal) for guidelines on the written project
proposal document. You will also, on the due date for the proposal,
present your proposal to the class. This will be a slide presentation
no more than five minutes long (strictly enforced!), followed by a
discussion with the class and feedback from me.

Someone on your team should be taking notes during the feedback
portion, as you will need them for your updated proposal.

####Proposal grading criteria
The proposal is worth **3.5%** of your final grade. The criteria are:

- All required information is included and complete (1.5%).
- Your writing is clear and comprehensible without significant
	spelling or grammar errors (1%).
- Your presentation is of the correct length and clearly communicates
	your proposal (1%).

###Updated proposal
After your presentation, you will update your written proposal based
on the feedback from me and the class, and turn in the new version.
See the sidebar for the due date.

####Updated proposal grading criteria
The updated proposal is worth **1.5%** of your final grade. The criteria are:

- You have responded to the feedback and updated your proposal to
	reflect the concerns of the instructor and class (1.5%).

###Team participation weekly check-ins
Each week, you will (individually) fill out a very brief survey,
explaining what each team member, including your self, did to
contribute to the project during the preceding week. The responses to
this survey will help me understand how your group is functioning and
alert me to any problems in the group early.

####Team participation grading criteria
Your team participation is worth an overall **15%** of your final
grade. This is divided into two parts.

Filling out the team participation survey every week is worth **5%**
of your final grade. I will forgive one missed survey, so your grade
will be divided evenly amongst the number of surveys minus one.

Your group participation grade is worth **10%** of your final grade;
this grade will be based on the feedback from your team members.

###Mid-project check-ins
At two roughly evenly-spaced intervals throughout the semester, you
will turn in mid-project check-in documents. These documents are
intended to serve several purposes: first, to give you some concrete
deadlines to get work done by; second, to get you to self-assess your
progress; and finally, to work towards the final paper deliverable.

As with the final deliverable, the check-in documents should be in the
format of an [ACM SIGCHI Extended
Abstract](https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/guide-to-submission-formats/),
and roughly in the pattern of a research paper such as those we read
in class. Your goal is to make progress towards the final paper; as
such, each check-in should be a clearly-written draft paper with at
least the following sections:

- Introduction, including the project idea, motivation, planned
	contributions, etc...
- Related work section with more fleshed-out relevant work
- Outline of body with the approach you are taking
- Current milestones with progress towards each
- Remaining milestones with planned progress towards each
- If changes are made to milestones, explanations of why

At both check-in dates, you will turn in this paper draft;
additionally, at the second check-in, you will turn in a draft of your
final video (see "Final deliverables" below). The video draft can
include parts that don't require a working prototype (if you are doing
an implementation project) such as explanation of motivation, process
involved, etc.

####Mid-project check-in grading criteria
The mid-project check-ins are each worth **2.5%** of your final grade,
for a cumulative total of **5%**. The grading criteria are the same
for both, and are as follows:

- All required information is included and complete (1.5%).
- Your writing is clear and comprehensible without significant
	spelling or grammar errors (1%).

###Final paper
All groups will turn in a final paper describing their project.
The paper must be in the format of an [ACM SIGCHI Extended
Abstract](https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/guide-to-submission-formats/),
and in the pattern of a research paper such as those we read in class.
This latter part means that you should not include the milestones
sections; the paper should essentially be a draft of something that
could be submitted to a conference such as CHI or MobileHCI. The
paper must be submitted in PDF format via Slack, and should contain
roughly the following sections:

- Introduction, including the project idea, motivation, planned
	contributions, etc...
- Related work section with more fleshed-out relevant work
- Outline of body with the approach you are taking
- Results and analysis
- Conclusions and future work

If you did not accomplish what you set out to do, you should spend
some time in your paper explaining why, but more importantly, what you
learned.

####Final paper grading criteria
The final paper is worth **4%** of your final grade; the criteria are
as follows:

- All required information is included and complete (1%).
- You achieved what you said you would do, taking into account updates
	during the project check-ins (2%).
- Your writing is clear and comprehensible without significant
	spelling or grammar errors (1%).

###Final video
In addition to the paper, you will also create a 30-second video
describing the project, submitted via a link to a YouTube or Vimeo
video. The video should be in the style of a CHI video preview, and
clearly show:

- the name of your project;
- the course number and year of this class;
- what you were trying to accomplish;
- and what you did accomplish.

####Final video grading criteria
The final video is worth **3%** of your final grade, graded according to
the requirements above.

###Final presentation
During finals week, each group will present their project to the class
in a 15-minute talk (strictly enforced). For groups that implemented
something, a demo is appropriate (although not required).

The talk should follow roughly the layout of your paper, introducing
and motivating the project, summarizing the related work, discussing
what you did and how you did it, and talking about your findings and
the implications thereof.

####Final presentation grading criteria
The final presentation is worth **4%** of your final grade, according
to the following criteria:

- Slides are clear, easy to read, have correct grammar and
	spelling, and consist of more than just text (1%)
- Presentation is practiced, presenters speak clearly and explain the
	project well, presenters do not just read the slides (1%)
- Presentation presents the required information (2%)
