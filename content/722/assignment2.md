Title: Individual Assignment 2
Template: 722

##Introduction
In this assignment, you will observe peoples' behavior around a
specific mobile application. Choose a particular application on a
mobile device (it doesn't necessarily have to be a phone!). Find two
test users who do not frequently use the app (though they could have
tried it before).  The test users can be friends, family, coworkers,
etc., but should not be other students in this class. Choose 3 tasks
that can be completed using the app. Once you have identified the app,
study tasks, and test users, conduct the user study. Here is a rough
outline for how to conduct the study:

1. Meet the user at a location where they might typically use the app
	 (café, workplace, etc.). Try to avoid conducting the study in a
	 lab setting, if possible.
2. Explain the purpose of the study, and the app that the participant
	 will be testing.
3. Present the app that you will be testing to the user. Ideally you
	 can install the app on the user’s own device, but this is not
	 essential.
4. In sequence, present the tasks, and ask the user to perform tasks.
	 Ideally, the tasks should be as concrete as possible (e.g., "Load
	 the RIT homepage in the browser" instead of "Load a web page in
	 the browser"). The user should complete each task 3 or more times.
5. While the user is performing the task, observe them. Do they make
	 any errors? Are any parts of the task unclear or confusing? Are any
	 steps inefficient? Try not to guide the user during the task, but
	 to let them explore it at their own pace. Take notes.
6. After the tasks are completed, you may want to ask questions to
	 clarify what you saw during the activity.
7. Once the tasks are completed, thank the participant.

##Deliverables
Once you have collected your data, you will write a two page
report on what you observed. You will also give a five minute
presentation in class on the due date. For both, you should include
drawings or images to help the class understand what you observed.
You will turn in both your report and your slides via Slack on the due
date.

##Grading
This assignment is worth 7% of your final grade. Both your written
report **(4%)** and your in-class presentation **(3%)** should adhere
to the following criteria:

- Clear, easy to read, without grammar or spelling errors
- Clearly describes how the observation was conducted: when and
	where you went, what app you tested, what tasks you had the
	participant do.
- Clearly describes the participants: age, occupation, experience
	with mobile devices and apps; don't use a photograph or their real
	name, however.
- Describe your observations for each task: Were any tasks
	especially easy/difficult? What aspects of the tasks were slow,
	confusing, etc.? Note that if you don’t have any interesting
	observations after your first participant, you may need to adjust
	your study tasks or your chosen app. Include pictures to
	illustrate your points.
- Includes interesting concrete examples, sketches/images where
	appropriate
- Describe three possible improvements that could be made to the
	user interface to avoid the problems the users had.
