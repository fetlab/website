Title: Class Presentation Guidelines
Template: 722

[TOC]

##Introduction
Each student is required to teach part of one classe during the
course of the semester. You will either present a set of papers and
lead discussion, or present a technology tutorial on a subject
relevant to the class.  You must sign up for your presentation date on
the spreadsheet linked from the main class page. This spreadsheet will
give you the latest date by which you must notify me of what you will
present; in general, it will be two weeks before the presentation
date. Note that this date is the **final** deadline; if you have
questions about what you will present, or want to check with me to see
if it's okay, you should do so _in advance_ of this deadline.

##Paper presentation
If you choose this option, you will select at least three full-length
papers to present to the class. The papers should be relevant to the
class topic and related to each other. You might choose, for example,
papers that build on each other, or are on a related interaction
technique, or other topic. You will synthesize the knowledge in the
papers, present a coherent talk, and lead discussion about the work.

If you wish, you may draw your papers from the nine you chose for
[part 1 of the group project's individual effort
component](project_individual#part-1-initial-paper-exploration); the
papers still must adhere to the selection criteria below.

###Paper selection criteria
Each of the papers you select should meet the following criteria. If
you want to select something else, you should clear it with me first,
with a clear argument why.

- The papers should be **research papers** published in a scholarly
	journal or conference proceedings.
- The papers should be **full papers** of 8--10 pages.
	- If you want to use a longer paper (e.g. long journal article),
		clear it with me first.
	- If you want to use a shorter paper (e.g. CHI Extended Abstracts),
		you should clear it with me first, and be prepared to have two
		shorter papers count as one.
- The paper should be an HCI paper relevant to the topic of the class.
	If you have any doubts, ask. Sources for papers include:
	- [MobileHCI](http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE395)
	- [CHI](http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE151)
	- [ISWC](http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE336)
	- [UIST](http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE172)
	- [ASSETS](http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE205)

You should expect to spend at least 3--4 hours finding good papers to
present. If you turn in papers that don't meet these criteria, or seem
rushed (i.e. picking the top results from a Google search for the
topic name), you will be asked to select new papers and your grade
will be reduced 20%. **If you are unsure of whether your papers are
appropriate, you should contact me well before the papers
are due.**

###The presentation
You will present your papers on the assigned date. I will have
previously assigned _one_ of the papers to the class to read, but you
should not assume they have read all of them. However, your goal is
not to present every detail of the paper, but to clearly explain the
topic you've chosen, the main themes and takeaways, on how the
research is related to what we've done in class so far, and in
providing useful background information and content (e.g. videos,
follow-on research, related products, etc.).  You should also prepare
to lead the discussion. Think about interesting questions to discuss
and ways to connect your readings to the personal lives of your fellow
students.

You should prepare slides for the presentation, which you must turn in
to me by 11:59 pm on **the day before you present**. The penalty for late
slides is the same as for other assignments, as detailed on [the
syllabus](syllabus.html#late-assignments).

Your talk should be 15 minutes long (strictly enforced), and you
should be prepared to facilitate 15 minutes of discussion, for 30
minutes total (strictly enforced). This will leave us time for other
presentations or discussion.

###Grading
The presentation is worth 10% of your final grade. This breaks down as
follows:

- Choose appropriate papers and turn in the list by the given
	notification date **(2%)**
- Slides turned in by 11:59 pm of the day before your presentation **(4%)**
- Presentation quality **(3%)**
	- Slides are clear, easy to read, and have correct grammar and
		spelling
	- Presentation identifies main themes
	- Presentation gives details of papers (titles, publication
		locations, authors)
	- Presentation uses images, videos (not just text)
	- Presentation brings in interesting content from outside of the
		papers (current technology, project videos, etc.)
	- Presentation is of appropriate length
- Discussion quality **(3%)**
	- Presenter is prepared with questions beyond the obvious (e.g.
		"what did you think?" is not a good question)
	- Presenter guides discussion
	- Presenter is prepared to guide discussion for appropriate length
		of time

##Technology tutorial
If you choose this option, you will present a tutorial for a
technology relevant to what we are doing in the class. This could be a
hardware or software topic, and could be related to something you are
working on for your class project, for another class, or for your own
enjoyment.

###Selection criteria
You should select a technology to present that you know well enough to
teach a single class about. I define "technology" fairly loosely
here---you could teach, for example:

- a programming language (e.g. Swift);
- a technique for interacting with devices (e.g. Cordova);
- a useful skill for MobileHCI work (e.g. an overview of computer vision);
- a handy library (e.g. OpenCV);
- basic principles (e.g. an introduction to electronics);
- hardware skills (e.g. how to use an Arduino);
- or something else.

**If you are unsure of whether your topic is appropriate, you should
contact me well before the notification date.**

###The presentation
You will present your tutorial on the assigned date. If there is setup
for the class to do to be able to follow along (e.g. installing the
Arduino environment), you must notify me at least **one week** before
the date of your presentation, and provide clear instructions that I
can pass on. Your presentation should provide a rationale of why the
particular technology is relevant to the class, clear instructions on
how students can use the technology (e.g. where to download, where to
order parts, etc.), and details of the tutorial itself.

Your entire presentation should be 30 minutes long (strictly
enforced). If you are particularly interested in presenting longer
(e.g. for a more complex topic), talk to me _well in advance_ of the
notification date.

You should prepare slides for the presentation, which you must turn in
to me by 11:59 pm **the day before you present**. The penalty for late
slides is the same as for other assignments, as detailed on [the
syllabus](syllabus.html#late-assignments).

###Grading
The presentation is worth 10% of your final grade. This breaks down as
follows:

- Choose an appropriate topic and notify me by the given notification
	date **(2%)**
- Slides turned in by 11:59 pm of the day before your presentation **(4%)**
- Presentation quality **(6%)**
	- Slides are clear, easy to read, and have correct grammar and
		spelling
	- Presentation identifies reasons for technology
	- Presentation gives details of technology (who made it, where to
		get it, etc.)
	- Presentation clearly teaches useful details
	- Presentation uses images, videos (not just text)
	- Presentation is of appropriate length
