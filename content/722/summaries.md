Title: Reading Summaries Instructions
Template: 722

Each week, a number of readings will be assigned. You must read
_all_ of the papers, as well as the book chapter, and submit reading
summaries each week. Reading summaries will be submitted as a Post via
Slack.

The summary for each paper and book chapter should consist of answers
to the following questions:

1. What research problems were the authors investigating?
2. How did the authors attempt to answer these questions? Did they
	 succeed?
3. What follow-on possibilities do you see?

The Slack Post is a single text box, but we will usually
have multiple readings. Therefore, you should format your readings as
follows:

```
Title of the first reading

1. Answer to question 1
2. Answer to question 2
3. Answer to question 3

----

Title of the second reading

1. Answer to question 1
2. Answer to question 2
3. Answer to question 3

----

Title of the third reading

1. Answer to question 1
2. Answer to question 2
3. Answer to question 3
```

Gaze Enhanced Speech Recognition
</p><p>
1. The authors wanted to find out if they could improve the accuracy
	 of speech recognition by incorporating gaze tracking. By
	 understanding what the user has looked at, they theorize that they
	 can restrict the speech recognizer's language model.
</p><p>
2. The authors ran a study to collect eye gaze data in conjunction
	 with speech-based navigation of an interface, and then they used
	 this information to adapt a speech recognition engine to use they
	 eye gaze data. Their method worked well, achieving a 10%
	 improvement in errors.
</p><p>
3. The authors only considered a static situation, reading a web page.
	 It would be interesting to try to do the same task in a more
	 realistic scenario, by having users interact with objects in the
	 environment by looking at them.
