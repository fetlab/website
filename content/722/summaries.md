Title: Reading Summaries Instructions
Template: 722

Each week, a number of readings will be assigned. You must read
_all_ of the papers, as well as the book chapters, and submit reading
summaries each class day. Summaries are due every Tuesday and Thursday
at 1:59 pm, and should summarize all of the papers you read since the
last time you turned in summaries; that is, the papers or book
chapters that we will be discussing in class on any given day.

Reading summaries should be submitted in Google Forms at [this
link](https://goo.gl/forms/G53UxpLNK98XUQKi1).

The summary for each paper will consist of answers
to the following questions:

1. What research problems were the authors investigating?
2. How did the authors attempt to answer these questions? Did they
	 succeed?
3. What follow-on possibilities do you see?

If a given book chapter doesn't fit well with the above questions, 
the summary for that chapter can alternately consist of answers to the
following questions:

1. What were the main points being made in the chapter?
2. How were those points made?
3. Do you agree with the points? How can you expand on or apply them?

Gaze Enhanced Speech Recognition
</p><p>
1. The authors wanted to find out if they could improve the accuracy
	 of speech recognition by incorporating gaze tracking. By
	 understanding what the user has looked at, they theorize that they
	 can restrict the speech recognizer's language model.
</p><p>
2. The authors ran a study to collect eye gaze data in conjunction
	 with speech-based navigation of an interface, and then they used
	 this information to adapt a speech recognition engine to use they
	 eye gaze data. Their method worked well, achieving a 10%
	 improvement in errors.
</p><p>
3. The authors only considered a static situation, reading a web page.
	 It would be interesting to try to do the same task in a more
	 realistic scenario, by having users interact with objects in the
	 environment by looking at them.

##Grading
The reading summaries are worth **10%** of your final grade. Each will
be evaluated based on whether you have provided the requested
information, and whether it looks to me like you actually read the
paper. I will discard the lowest-graded summary.
