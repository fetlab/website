##Course Format
This is a seminar-style class. Students are expected to complete all
background reading before class, to make presentations, ask questions,
and offer their thoughts on topics being discussed. Students will
complete individual assignments and one group project.

##Course Objectives
Students will…

- understand where and how mobile, wearable, and ubiquitous HCI
	differs from HCI;
- gain a foundation of contemporary and classic mobile, wearable, and
	ubiquitous HCI research;
- identify and understand current challenges in mobile, wearable, and
	ubiquitous HCI;
- learn to think beyond "brick" devices (e.g., phones, tables) to new
	interaction modalities;
- understand challenges in evaluating mobile, wearable, and ubiquitous
	interfaces.

##Course Materials
The books for the course are _There's Not an App For That_ by Simon
Robinson, Matt Jones, and Gary Marsden; and _Smart Things: Ubiquitous
Computing User Experience Design_ by Mike Kuniavsky. They is available
via the campus bookstore as well as in digital form from online
retailers such as Amazon.

We will read many papers in the course as well; most may be found on
the ACM Digital Library, IEEExplore, or via Google Scholar.

##Course Policies
###Late Assignments
Assignments turned in within 24 hours of the due date and time will
lose 25% credit. For each additional 24 hours of lateness, an
additional 10% will be taken off.

###Attendance
Students are expected to attend each class session, and to arrive on
time. Students who miss class for any reason are responsible for
gathering information about what was missed, and alerting the
professor to how they will make up the in-class activities. No email,
web surfing, texting, or phone use during class.

###Academic Integrity
Students should be sure to review RIT's official policies concerning
academic integrity. Violations of academic integrity (cheating, double
submission, or plagiarism) will result in a failing grade **for the
entire class**!

###Assignments and Grading
There are a number of assignments in this class. Each contributes a
percentage to your final grade:

{% set g_setup =  2 %}
{% set g_summ  = 10 %}
{% set g_pres  = 10 %}
{% set g_assg  = 21 %}
{% set g_part  = 10 %}
{% set g_pind  = 12 %}
{% set g_pgrp  = 20 %}
{% set g_ppart = 15 %}
{% set g_extra =  5 %}

<table class="table table-condensed center-block" style="width:75%" markdown="1">
<thead><tr><th>Item</th><th> Percentage</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td>Class setup                       </td><td> {{g_setup}}%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reading summaries                 </td><td> {{g_summ}}%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paper or technology presentation  </td><td> {{g_pres}}%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Individual assignments            </td><td> {{g_assg}}%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Class participation               </td><td> {{g_part}}%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Project individual effort         </td><td> {{g_pind}}%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Project group effort              </td><td> {{g_pgrp}}%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Project group participation       </td><td> {{g_ppart}}%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Extra credit                      </td><td> {{g_extra}}%</td></tr>
<tr><td><bold>Total                       </td><td>105%</td></tr>
</table>

Details of how each of these items are graded may be found in the
individual items below; however, note that distributed amongst all of
the items, _writing quality_ counts for almost **10%** of your grade!

####Class setup ({{g_setup}}%)
This portion of your grade includes getting set up on Slack and
following the other instructions for getting set up for the class.
See [this page for Slack instructions](using_slack.html), and [the
main page](index.html) list of assignments for other information.

####Reading summaries ({{g_summ}}%)
We will read approximately three research papers each week. The papers
will be assigned the Tuesday of the preceding week. Students are
expected to read each paper each week and to post a brief summary
(100–300 words) to the course discussion forum; these summaries are
due by the start of the class in which the paper will be discussed.
Guidelines for the reading summaries can be found
[here](summaries.html).

####Paper or technology presentation ({{g_pres}}%)
Each student will present a group of papers and lead discussion,
or will do a technology tutorial. More information is given on
[this page](presentation_guidelines.html).

####Individual assignments ({{g_assg}}%)
There will be various individual assignments throughout the course of
the class. Peer evaluations from your team members will also be
included in this grade.

####Class participation ({{g_part}}%)
Much of the class will be discussion-based. There will also be
in-class activities. This grade reflects the amount of participation
during the class. Starting in the second week, class participation
will be assessed each class period using the following rubric (adapted
from [Stephen Voida’s
guidelines](http://stephen.voida.com/uploads/Teaching/Teaching/H566%20Syllabus.pdf):

- 100%: Serving as a discussion leader or actively participating in
	the discussion; contributing multiple times to the discussion with
	thoughtful, relevant comments or questions.
- 75%: Moderate participation in the class discussion; contributing
	with relevant comments or questions.
- 50%: Physically present but not engaged in the in-class discussion;
	not paying attention, buried in a laptop, etc.
- 0%: Not physically present in class.

####Project ({{g_pind + g_pgrp + g_ppart}}%)
Projects will be evaluated on several factors: the proposal, the
post-feedback updated proposal, the mid-project check-ins, and the
final presentation, paper, and deliverable (if applicable).

There are multiple parts to the project grade:

- {{g_pind}}%: Individual part
- {{g_pgrp}}%: Group part
- {{g_ppart}}%: Group participation

####Extra credit ({{g_extra}}%)
 There may be extra credit, worth up to 5%.
