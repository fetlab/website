Title: Team Formation
Template: 722

I will assign project teams; however, I will do so with input from
students. In order to provide this input, by the date in the sidebar
you will send me a Slack message with the following information:

- A brief explanation of the technical, HCI, and design skills that
	you have that you think might be relevant for this class. These
	should be skills that you are particularly confident in. The purpose
	of this requirement is for me to understand how to balance teams
	based on skills as well as preference. As an example, you might send
	me something like:
	- _Java: I've used Java for three semesters and know how to write
		basic Android applications._
	- _Web design: I'm really good at CSS and Javascript._
- The names of any students in the class who you particularly _want_
	to work with, and the reasons that you want to work with each of
	them.
- The names of any students in the class who you particularly _do not
	want_ to work with, and the reasons that you don't want to work with
	each of them.

I will keep these names and reasons _completely confidential_, but
will take them into account when forming groups. The **main** thing that
I will take into account is a balance between technical and design
skills.

Note: please don’t ask me why I formed your group in the way I formed
it. I won’t tell you.
