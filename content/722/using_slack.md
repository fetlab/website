Title: Using Slack
Template: 722

Slack is a system that is like a combination of instant messaging,
email, and forums. We'll use Slack in the class for annoucements,
discussions, and getting help.

The URL for Slack for our class is
[http://hcin722-spring16.slack.com](http://hcin722-spring16.slack.com).

To get connected to Slack, [click this
link](https://hcin722-spring16.slack.com/signup/) and sign up with
your RIT email address (don't use `@mail.rit.edu` but just the
`@rit.edu` form).

**Ensure that you have some way to get notifications from Slack**, as this
will be the main method by which I communicate with the class. There
are a wide variety of [deskop and mobile
apps](https://slack.com/downloads), and you can also visit the
[notifications
settings](https://hcin722-spring16.slack.com/account/notifications)
for your account and set up email notifications.

##Channels
Slack is organized into "channels," which are topic-specifc areas.
I've set up a number of channels to start with, and may add some more
as the semester proceeds. Slack organizes channels alphabetically. At
the start of class, we have:

- **#general**: For general questions and discussions that don't fit
	into any of the other channels.
- **#ia1**: I'll create a channel for each assignment. This channel is
	for Individual Assignment 1. You can use this to ask questions
	specifically about IA1, post tips and inspirations, or anything else
	related to the assignment.
- **#inspirations**: Post general inspirations and examples of
	Internet-enabled devices here.
- **#random**: For stuff unrelated or only somewhat related to class.
	Jokes, funny videos, etc. Be nice.

##Mentions
If you want to ensure that someone (such as me) sees your message, use
a mention. You do this like Twitter: use the `@` symbol with the
person's username. For example: `@dan I'm missing a wire from my kit.`
When you type the `@` symbol Slack will show you a list of people so
you don't have to remember usernames.

##Direct messages
You can do a direct chat with someone via the Direct Messages menu on
the left. You can set up a direct chat with multiple people as well.
This can be seen only by the people involved in the chat. You can use
direct messages to communicate with me regarding confidential class
matters such as grades. If you have questions which might benefit
other students with the answers, please post them to one of the public
channels (and optionally use `@dan` to get my attention).

##More help
The [Slack support site](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) has many
articles on using Slack. Or you can post a question to **#general**.
