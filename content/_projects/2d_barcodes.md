Title: Printed-on 2D "acoustic barcodes"
Kind: SWHW

[Previous research at
CMU](http://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/AcousticBarcodes)
illustrated _acoustic barcodes_, a pattern of ridges which make a
characteristic sound when scratched. Can we print small areas which
have the same property into 3D-printed objects, so that a user can
simply use a fingernail and scratch an area of interest? This could be
done by varying the layer height or other properties of the 3D
printing process.
