Title: "Lint" for 3D Modeling
kind: SW

[Lint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) for software
finds problems in code. Can we make something similar for augmented
fabrication? This would involve modifying a 3D design environment to
check for problems of symmetry, centering, objects almost but not
quite touching, and so on, and providing feedback to the user about
these problems.
