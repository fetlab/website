Title: Heat-morphing "4D" printing
Kind: SWHW

Recent work from the [CMU Morphing Matter
Lab](https://morphingmatter.cs.cmu.edu/) has shown how standard 3D
printers using standard plastic can produce objects which change shape
when heat is applied. Can we take this principle further, to create
objects which move or change shape when a user interacts with them?
