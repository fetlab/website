Title: Air table construction and control
Kind: SWHW

We are working on a large-scale air tableâ€”imagine an air hockey table
with each jet of air individually controllable. There is a lot of
mechanical construction to be done, as well as software work (both
Arduino-level and computer control) to create interesting interactions
and demos.
