Title: Interaction via eytracking
Kind: SW

Can we control objects in the environment solely via eye tracking? By
using the _vestibuluo-ocular reflex_, which is the property that keeps
our eyes stil when we're looking at something, we might be able to get
information about how the head is moving and use this motion as a
control mechanism.
