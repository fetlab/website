Title: "Familiar object" database
Kind: SW

A frequent problem for novices in 3D modeling is understanding size.
Can we make reference to a database of standardized "familiar objects"
(e.g., consumer electronics with known sizes like phones) to use as
in-software reference items? This could help novices get an idea of
the true size of their model, and possibly could also serve as
reference geometry.
