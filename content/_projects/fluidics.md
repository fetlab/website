Title: Fluidic interaction
Kind: SW

[Fluidics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluidics), or _fluid logic_,
is a principle that uses air to perform computation. How can we use
this principle to create 3D printed objects that become interactive
with only air input? This would allow the quick creation of useful
objects without any complex assembly. This project involves a lot of
experimentation with fabrication, as well as reading historical
literature about design for fluidics.
