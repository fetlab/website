Title: "Pluggable holes" for pneumatic interaction
Kind: HW

This short project involves experimenting with "pluggable holes". An
ongoing project looks at using small holes printed into hollow objects
to enable pneumatic interaction; however, 3D printing holes at various
angles with precision sizes is difficult. The project involves
experimenting with a modular system where "plugs" are printed with the
holes at a controlled angle so they can be inserted into an object
with larger, less-controlled "plug holes".
