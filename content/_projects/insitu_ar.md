Title: In-situ 1:1 design via AR
Kind: SW

Lots of fabrication activities concentrate on small, handheld objects.
How can we design for larger objects, like furniture? Can we do this
at a 1:1 scale, situated in the real world? Augmented reality could be
a good way to do this. What kind of tools and visualization ability is
needed?
