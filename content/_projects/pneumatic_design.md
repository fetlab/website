Title: Pneumatic printing design environment
Kind: SW

In our lab, we're looking at pneumatic (air-driven) interaction.
However, we need a design environment that allows the construction of
tubes, holes, and various other features in 3D meshes. This project
would involve using graphics libraries to construct or modify a design
environment to make this task easier.
