Title: Modify 3D printer for soft silicone printing
Kind: HW

This is a relatively straightforward projects, involving following the
procedure shown [here](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/3d-silicone-printer)
to build a 3D printer capable of printing objects in soft silicone.
This would enable us to make highly flexible 3D-printed objects, which
then could become interactive with air or other actuation mechanisms.
