Title: Ultraviolet 3D-printed barcodes
Kind: HW

It could be useful to embed visually recognizable information into 3D
prints. This project involves augmenting a 3D printer to add
ultraviolet dye to an in-progress print in such a way that a UV camera
can recognize a barcode formed from the dye. This could be used to
show that an object is authentic or otherwise indicate its source or
identity.
