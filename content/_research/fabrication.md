Digital fabrication equipment, like 3D printers and laser cutters, is
becoming increasingly available and affordable to home users.
Currently, however, it's difficult for non-experts to design and
fabricate their own objects. Our research in this area concentrates on
helping non-experts through _augmented fabrication_---fabricating
directly with existing objects, rather than being constrained to
traditional, standalone computer-aided design interfaces.  Our
research efforts in this area include:

####Studying fabrication
To help people better use digital fabrication technology, we want to
understand the problems they're running into now. We're doing
ethnographically-inspired research into how current users of 3D
printers are using their devices, what problems they run into, and how
they're overcoming those problems. Currently, we're looking at the
[e-NABLE](http://enablingthefuture.org) community---a worldwide group
of volunteers who 3D print prosthetic hands for kids---and how its
volunteer fabricators design, customize, print and assemble the hands.

####Fabricating functional objects
Right now it's easy for anyone to download and print a pre-designed
object from [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1095858),
but _designing_ an object to make it personal is a lot harder. We're
working on tools to help novices customize and print their own
Internet-connected objects, from a bird that chirps for Twitter
notifications to a box that sends a text message when the washing
machine's done.

####Fabrication helpers
Digital fabrication can be tricky. Whether making an entirely new
object with a 3D printer or modifying an existing object with a laser
cutter, lots of specific knowledge is required. We're working on
building new hardware and software tools to help people more quickly
and easily design for fabrication. Examples in this area include
connected tools for measuring existing objects, _in-situ_ design and
preview for laser cutting, and automatically changing settings for
fabrication based on the material to be used.
