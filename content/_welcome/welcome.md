Welcome to the Future Everyday Technology Research Lab (FETLab) at the
Rochester Institute of Technology. The focus of our research is on
making the tools of digital fabrication---like 3D printing and laser
cutting---accessible to non-experts, and on improving the
usability of wearable and mobile computing devices.
