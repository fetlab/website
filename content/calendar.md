Title: Calendar
Template: calendar

This calendar should display in your local timezone. As a sanity
check, my day usually starts at 9:00 am Copenhagen time.

I strongly prefer to cluster meetings, so when proposing a meeting,
please pick a time adjacent to something else if possible.

Event titles with **[t]** in them indicate "tentative," meaning that
spot may become free in the future.
