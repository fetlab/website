###Prospective Students

I am looking for undergraduate and graduate students interested in
improving human interaction with wearable computing and personal
fabrication.  Are you a student interested in working with me? If so,
please [read this first](prospective_students.html), then feel free to
contact me via email and we can arrange a time to meet.

###Travel
I travel frequently. When I'm traveling, I may be more difficult than
usual to reach via email.
