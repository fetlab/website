The Future Everyday Technology Research Lab is a part of RIT's [B.
Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information
Science](http://gccis.rit.edu).  To contact an individual, please see
each person's information above.

We are located on RIT's campus in Orange Hall, labeled **ORN** on the
map below. (As of Fall 2016, we will be located in the Golisano
College of Computing and Information Sciences, labeled **GOL**, in
room 2330.)  Once you arrive at RIT, visit the Welcome Center (**WEL**
on the map) to get a temporary parking permit; you may then park in
any non-reserved space. The closest lots to the FETLab are **J** and
**S**.
