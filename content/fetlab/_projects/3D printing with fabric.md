Title: 3D printing with fabric

#### Description

How can 3D printing combine with fabric to allow us to create new things? We published work at CHI this year showing basic ideas and interaction primitives (see the paper [here](http://fetlab.rit.edu/publications/2017-Stretching%20the%20Bounds%20of%203D%20Printing%20with%20Embedded%20Textiles.pdf)); now we're taking the work further to explore print-flat foldable shapes.

We showed in our paper that we can significantly speed up the time that it takes to print an object by printing only its "shell"â€”decomposing the object into panels which are then assembled into a 3D object. For example:

Our current work involves:

- making more-complex objects printable (e.g. the [Stanford bunny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_bunny))
- adding tabs for true "snap together" functionality
- exploring adding electronics to make interactive 3D objects

#### Potential skills needed
Some or all of the following:

- 3D design/CAD experience (making parametric tabs); Fusion 360 knowledge a plus
- Understanding of how 3D printers work, including GCode
- basic electronics (LEDs, capacitive sensors, buttons, etc
