#### Description
We're working to help anyone who can use a computer to design and fabricate their own customized Internet of Things objects. The goal is to let people arrange physical components in relation to a virtual, to-be-printed object, so they can easily design objects such as the above Minecraft dog with embedded electronics.

We're currently using [littleBits](http://littlbits.cc) as the electronics because they're very easy to work with, and the [HP Sprout](http://sprout.hp.com/) computer to provide projected augmented reality.
