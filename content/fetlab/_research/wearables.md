Title: Wearable and Mobile Computing

Our work in wearable and mobile computing concentrates on enabling
_mobile microinteractions_---interactions with a device that happen
very quickly, with minimal interruption to whatever you were already
doing. Our projects in this area include:

####New interaction techniques
How can we quickly interact with our devices? We invent new methods
for doing input and output with wearable devices. Previous work
we've done in this area includes
[rings](http://danielashbrook.com/magnetic-ring/),
[watches](http://danielashbrook.com/round-smartwatch/),
[pendants](http://danielashbrook.com/gesture-pendant/),
[bands](http://danielashbrook.com/facet/) and
[gestures](http://danielashbrook.com/enabling-mobile-microinteractions/).
We're currently investigating non-speech-based hands-free
microinteraction input techniques.

####Avoiding mobile addiction
Today's mobile devices are amazingly capable---perhaps _too_ capable.
It can be easy to get sucked in to the world of the handheld screen.
We're looking at ways to gently (at first!) help a person avoid
over-using certain addictive applications.
