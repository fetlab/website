Our work in wearable and mobile computing concentrates on enabling
_mobile microinteractions_---interactions with a device that happen
very quickly, with minimal interruption to whatever you were already
doing. Our projects in this area include:

####New interaction techniques
How can we quickly interact with our devices? We invent new methods
for doing input and output with wearable devices. Previous work
we've done in this area includes
[rings](http://danielashbrook.com/magnetic-ring/),
[watches](http://danielashbrook.com/round-smartwatch/),
[pendants](http://danielashbrook.com/gesture-pendant/),
[bands](http://danielashbrook.com/facet/) and
[gestures](http://danielashbrook.com/enabling-mobile-microinteractions/).
We're currently investigating non-speech-based hands-free
microinteraction input techniques.
