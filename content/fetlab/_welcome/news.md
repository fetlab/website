####Work with us
The FETLab is recruiting PhD students for Fall 2016! We're currently
working on a wide variety of projects in the area of improving the
ability of non-experts to use digital fabrication equipment such as 3D
printers, laser cutters, and computer-controlled milling machines.

We're looking for strongly motivated students with technical skills in
the areas of computer graphics, computer vision, mechatronics,
or robotics.

See [this page](/dan/prospective_students.html) for more information
on working with the FETLab.

####Tenure-track faculty hiring
The Information Sciences and Technologies department is hiring in HCI!
See [this page](/dan/faculty_search.html) for more information and to
find the link to apply.
