###What
####Talk Title
Unlocking Data, Unlocking Interaction

####Abstract
The applications we create are framed by the tools we use to create
them. On one hand, tools codify effective practice and empower design.
On the other, that same codification eventually constrains design. My
research examines new approaches to interactive systems in light of
this tradeoff, often with an emphasis on unlocking existing
codifications to enable new designs. This talk will focus on three
examples:

- I will first present our work on unlocking data with interactive
	machine learning. Dominant models of interaction fail to support
	expressiveness and control in many emerging forms of everyday data.
	Exploring such domains as web image search and gesture recognition,
	our work shows how interactive machine learning can support people
	in extending the underlying language of an interaction.
- I will then present our work on using pixel-based reverse
	engineering to unlock existing graphical interfaces, allowing
	runtime modification of those interfaces without their source.
	Pixel-based methods allow prototyping new possibilities atop the
	existing ecosystem of applications and tools, accelerating
	innovation and informing the next-generation ecosystem.
- Finally, I will consider how these challenges combine in the
	emergence of self-tracking and personal informatics. Data is no
	longer a distant concept, but an everyday barrier to interaction,
	self-knowledge, and personal empowerment. The tools we create to
	support these applications will define the future of everyday
	interaction with personal data.

Given these examples, I argue research must consider not only specific
applications, but also the assumptions codified by underlying tools
and how those tools frame our understanding of what application
designs are even possible.

###Biography
James Fogarty is an Associate Professor of Computer Science &
Engineering at the University of Washington
([https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty)).
His broad research interests are in engineering interactive systems,
often with a focus on the role of tools in developing, deploying, and
evaluating new approaches to the human obstacles surrounding everyday
adoption of ubiquitous computing and intelligent interaction. He is
also Director of the DUB Group, the University of Washington's
cross-campus initiative advancing research and education in
Human-Computer Interaction and Design
([http://dub.washington.edu](http://dub.washington.edu)).
