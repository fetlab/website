Title: Paper Reading Club
Template: paper_club

###Introduction

Welcome to Paper Reading Club! The purpose of this "club" is to get
together to read and discuss interesting HCI papers. While this goal
is nothing new, we have a small twist: we take an extra hour to sit
together and read the paper. There are a couple of reasons for doing
it this way. First, it's hard to carve out time to read a
paper---there is always something else that interrupts. Second, if
you've just read the paper, you're primed and ready for discussion.
Finally, it's a nice communal feeling to read as a group.

The only rule for Paper Reading Club is: read the paper on paper. That
is, don't read it on your laptop, or your phone, or your other device
that supports multitasking! That means read it on actual physical
paper, or something that acts like actual physical paper.

### When and where

Paper reading club usually happens from 3:00--5:00 on Fridays in the
FETLab, GOL-2330 (see the bottom of [the main page](/) for
directions). Look below to see if we have a paper scheduled this week.
