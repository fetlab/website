##About me
I am an Associate Professor in the [Human-Centered
Computing](http://www.diku.dk/english/research/hcc/) section of the
[Department of Computer Science](https://di.ku.dk/english) at the
[University of Copenhagen](https://ku.dk) in Copenhagen, Denmark.

I graduated in 2009 with my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [School
of Interactive Computing](http://www.ic.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia
Tech](http://www.gatech.edu).  Subsequently, I worked for [Nokia
Research](http://research.nokia.com) and [Samsung
Research](http://sisa.samsung.com) before returning to academia in
2014.

From 2014--2018 I was an Assistant Professor in the [Department of
Information Sciences and Technologies](http://ist.rit.edu/) and the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.rit.edu) of the
[Golisano College of Computing and Information
Sciences](http://www.rit.edu/gccis/) at the [Rochester Institute of
Technology](http://rit.edu) (RIT) in Rochester, New York, USA.

##Research
My research is in the area of **human-computer interaction**, where I
concentrate on new interaction techniques, devices, and applications.
Historically I have concentrated on **wearable and mobile computing**,
with the goal of allowing people to be less focused on their
technology and more engaged with the world, while still reaping the
creativity and productivity benefits of their devices. My current
research continues this thread while adding a second focus on helping
non-experts more easily understand and use **personal fabrication
technology** such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC routers.

My research has been supported by [HP](http://hp.com),
[Nokia](http://company.nokia.com), and the United States [National
Science Foundation](http://nsf.gov).

##RIT
Here is some information about what I did while I was at the Rochester
Institute of Technology from 2014--2018.

###Teaching
I taught two classes at RIT: HCIN-720 in Fall semesters, and HCIN-722
in Spring semesters.

####HCIN-720: Prototyping Wearable and Internet of Things Devices
_Software is no longer the only domain that practitioners of
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) find themselves involved in. There is
a “hardware renaissance” underway in Silicon Valley, and as a result
the computing industry is in need of user experience designers,
interaction designers, and HCI specialists who understand how to work
with people and hardware as well as with software. The goal of this
course is to teach students how to rapidly prototype and evaluate
systems that combine hardware and software._

###HCIN-722: HCI with Mobile, Wearable, and Ubiquitous Devices
_Modern computing devices include more than just mobile phones, with
wearable and ubiquitous (for example, Internet of Things) devices
rapidly emerging as additional platforms. These new devices offer
unique interaction capabilities and challenges. Students will learn to
think about and design effective interactions for mobile, wearable,
and ubiquitous computing devices. Students will also gain a background
in research in these areas. The main goal of the course is to enable
students to work with HCI for these types of devices._

HCIN-722 is a seminar-style course with projects: students read
research papers and discuss them in class; teach a class themselves
on a technical or theoretical topic; and engage in a semester-long
group project around a new wearable or mobile device.
