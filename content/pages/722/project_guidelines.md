[TOC]

##Description
There will be one project over the course of the semester. Projects
will be conducted by teams of 4--5 students; you are responsible for
forming your own teams. Use the `#team_formation` channel in Slack to
help you form teams.

The goal of the project is to perform a piece of new, original
research. This can be a study or an implementation.

###Study projects
If you want to run a study, it should be on the scale of a CHI Note or
Work-in-Progress. You can study something new or replicate a previous
study; if you want replicate a study, you must provide good
justification for why the prior study needs to be updated. For
example, Oulasvirta's [Interaction in 4-Second
Bursts](dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1055101) study was
conducted in the early days of smartphones and a number of things have
changed since then that might influence the results of a new study
(it's up to you to figure out what's changed!).

If your study will involve human participants (and if it doesn't, you
may be in the wrong class), you will need to submit an IRB
application. This application requires that you completely think out
all of the details of the study, including how you will recruit
participants, what the study procedure will be, and whether and how
you will compensate them. Talk to me soon so we can determine how best
to proceed.

Some ideas for study projects (note that in most cases I have not
checked to see whether these have been done already):

- How do people in cold environments use their phones with gloves? Or,
	how is touchscreen accuracy affected by touchscreen-compatible
	gloves?
- What are people's long-term experiences with fitness trackers?
- How do people use phone notifications? How do people use wearable
	notifications?
- Replicate Oulasvirta et al.'s [Interaction in 4-Second
	Bursts](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1055101) study
- Replicate Vadas et al.'s [Reading on the
	Go](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1152215.1152262) study
- Replicate Ashbrook et al.'s
	[Quickdraw](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1357054.1357092) study

###Implementation projects
Another option is to create something---hardware, software, or a
mixture. For this option, you can build on previous research work, but
it's not appropriate to re-implement something that's been done
already.

Some ideas for implementation projects:

- App for eyes-free music composition while walking (optionally
	include a hardware controller)
- Mobile
	[RSVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation)
	(Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) on phone, watch, or HMD
- Accessible eyes-free mobile keyboard with haptic or audio feedback
- Build a wearable keyboard
- Build and study peripheral notification
- Implement a mobile programming environment
- Address an issue from a prior study; for example, Naftali et al.'s
	(Accessibility in
	Context)[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2661334.2661372], a
	study of accessibility challenges in the real world

####Projects involving hardware
If you want to do a project involving hardware, I will purchase a
small amount of hardware for each group, but there must be a clear
justification for the need for it and the ability of the group to make
use of it (e.g., I won't buy you something just because it looks
cool). I have some resources already available for loan: one Pebble
smartwatch, one Samsung Galaxy Gear 1 smartwatch, five
Google Glass units, and several Arduinos, including the Bluetooth Low
Energy-based Light Blue Bean and the Particle Photon. I recommend the
use of [The Construct](http://hack.rit.edu), the on-campus makerspace,
which includes 3D printers, soldering facilities, and various other
useful tools.

##Deliverables
There are several items due at various points through the course; see
the right sidebar for the dates. Each deliverable should be turned in
via Direct Message to me on Slack. For all items, I expect
high-quality writing: check your spelling, avoid [passive
voice](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/539/01/), and
proofread (note writing resources on the [main page](index.html)).

<b style="color:red">Note that I will only accept PDF format for documents!</b>

###Proposal
The project proposal should be a well-written document approximately
two pages long, consisting of:

- Project title
- Group members and detailed roles (see the Advice section below)
- Project idea, including motivation
- Planned contributions
- Plan of attack with weekly milestones (E.g., a rough plan of how you
	will accomplish the work)
- Initial literature review (Has this been done before? What prior
	work is relevant?)
- What hardware, software, or other resources you might need, and how
	you plan to get them
- Success criteria (How will you know if you succeed? I will grade you
	partially on whether you met your own criteria.)

If you are having a hard time with your proposal, please come to my
office hours, email me, or otherwise discuss it with me.

###Updated proposal
Approximately 3--4 days after you turn in your proposal, I will give
you feedback. You will update your proposal based on my feedback and
turn in the new version.

###Mid-project check-ins
At two roughly evenly-spaced intervals throughout the semester, you
will turn in mid-project check-in documents. These documents are
intended to serve several purposes: first, to give you some concrete
deadlines to get work done by; second, to get you to self-assess your
progress; and finally, to work towards the final paper deliverable.

As with the final deliverable, the check-in documents should be in the
format of an [ACM SIGCHI Extended
Abstract](https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/guide-to-submission-formats/),
and roughly in the pattern of a research paper such as those we read
in class. Your goal is to make progress towards the final paper; as
such, each check-in should be a clearly-written draft paper with at
least the following sections:

- Introduction, including the project idea, motivation, planned
	contributions, etc...
- Related work section with more fleshed-out relevant work
- Outline of body with the approach you are taking
- Current milestones with progress towards each
- Remaining milestones with planned progress towards each
- If changes are made to milestones, explanations of why

At both check-in dates, you will turn in this paper draft;
additionally, at the second check-in, you will turn in a draft of your
final video (see "Final deliverables" below). The video draft can
include parts that don't require a working prototype (if you are doing
an implementation project) such as explanation of motivation, process
involved, etc.

###Final deliverables
All groups will turn in a final paper describing their project, as
well as a short (three minutes or less) video describing the project.
The paper must be in the format of an [ACM SIGCHI Extended
Abstract](https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/guide-to-submission-formats/),
and in the pattern of a research paper such as those we read in class.
This latter part means that you should not include the milestones
sections; the paper should essentially be a draft of something that
could be submitted to a conference such as CHI or MobileHCI.

###Final presentation
During finals week, each group will present their project to the class
in a 10-minute talk. For groups that implemented something, a demo is
appropriate (although not required).

##Grading
The project grade will be comprised of the following components:

- Proposal **(2.5%)**
- Updated proposal **(2.5%)**
- Check in 1 **(2.5%)**
- Check in 2 **(2.5%)**
- Final deliverables **(20%)**
	- Final paper **(15%)**
	- Video **(5%)**
- Team participation **(10%)**

###Group evaluations
At each deliverable (proposal, check ins, final deliverables) you will
use the peer evaluation functionality at
[http://peereval.rit.edu](http://peereval.rit.edu) to evaluate your
team members. This will allow me to keep track of how well the groups
are working together.

##Advice
Whether you are doing a study or an implementation, your goal is to
focus---focus on what you want to show or find out and the set of work
that will get you to that point. As you begin, you will have a
difficult time focusing, but I expect you to gain focus quickly. Part
of the way to get said focus is to read---read many, many research
papers related to your project. Don't just read the bare minimum
required for the class, but look at lots! You don't have to read
everything in-depth, but cultivate an understanding of the area in
which you want to do your project and find examples of what you think
are successful projects. Those papers will help you understand what
focus looks like for that kind of project.

Additionally, for whichever type of project you choose, ensure that
your skillset matches the needs of the project. This is not the time
to learn to program or to run a user study if you've never done those
things. Your groups should be balanced so that your skills complement
each other and let you complete the project. The detailed description
of team member roles should reflect the needed and available skills;
e.g., not just "Jane will do the programming and Fred will do the
design", but "Jane did machine learning in her internship with Google
and will handle the gesture recognition component of the project while
Fred's experience in HCIN-730 will allow him to design an ethnographic
study."

###Hardware
For hardware projects, there are many possible components and
platforms to use. I recommend using something that is Arduino-based,
as there is a lot of support online for this platform. In particular,
the [Light Blue Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean/) is a newer Arduino-compatible platform that
supports Bluetooth Low Energy and has a built-in batter, making it
nice for wearable projects. Good resources for hardware projects
include [SparkFun](http://sparkfun.com/), [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com),
and [SeeedStudio](http://seeedstudio.com/), as well as the Arduino
[website](http://arduino.cc) and [forums](http://forum.arduino.cc/).

###Software
For software projects, there are a number of ways to go. I personally
am a big fan of Python, which can use [Pygame](http://pygame.org) for
simple GUIs and [Qt](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide) for more
complex ones. On the Mac, both of these can be installed via
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh).  Another option is
[Kivy](http://kivy.org), which is a cross-platform Python framework
which will let you use Python to create both mobile and desktop apps.

Alternatively, using HTML and Javascript is a feasible approach.
[Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) will let you translate
applications written this way into mobile apps.

If you need an Apple developer account for this class, please let me
know ASAP and I will help you.
