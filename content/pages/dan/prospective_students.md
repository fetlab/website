##Advice for Prospective Students
I’m actively seeking undergraduate and graduate students to work with
me on research. However, not every student is a good fit. The advice
on this page will give you a sense what I’m looking for, so please
read this entire page before asking about a position. There are
several parts:

- [What I look for in general](#all_students)
- Advice for [potential capstone students](#capstone)
- Information specifically for [potential PhD students](#phd)

###For all potential students
####Interest in Research Required
I'm looking for students who are interested in being part of ongoing
and new **research projects** related to the goals of the lab. That
means if you're looking to flesh out your CV/résumé or to get some
additional software development experience, this is probably not for
you. Also, research efforts take time, so if you only have one
semester to devote to a project, it might be difficult to benefit from
the experience. Software and hardware we build is meant to test out
new ideas/techniques and to answer open research questions (i.e., it
might be buggy, incomplete, etc)---we are not focusing on building
commercial grade software. If that's your interest, pursuing an
industry internship may be more up your alley.

If on the other hand, you're truly interested in getting involved in
research---creating new user experiences and exploring unanswered
questions, you **may** be in the right place. For undergrads this could
also be an interest in trying out research to help you consider
graduate school options.

One of the best ways for me to judge whether you'd be a good fit for
the lab is for you to take a class with me first. That will give you a
sense for how I work with students and, depending on the course, the
kinds of research I do. It also gives me an opportunity to see you and
your skills in action. If possible, enroll in a class with me before
seeking a position in the lab---this is especially important if you are
new to RIT and in your first year of study here. 

####Motivation and Independence Required
Two key characteristics necessary to succeed in my lab are motivation
and independence. Doing research requires an excitement about solving
problems and a willingness to independently learn how other people
have solved similar problem and to acquire the skills necessary. I
provide a lot of guidance to students in attacking problems, but the
projects we work on are not usually easily broken down into simple "do
this, then do that" kinds of tasks.

####Skills I Look For
The research I do involves a variety of technical skills, and the
needs of particular projects vary. If you’re a graduate student you
should already be comfortable with a variety of these skills, beyond
a single class worth of learning. Undergraduates should be adept with
one or more and have a willingness to learn quickly about others.

- **Making and building:** almost all of my research takes place at
	the intersection between software and hardware. Do you have
	experience with Arduino or other electronics? Have you built robots,
	furniture, go-karts, a 3D printer, or made art?
- **Machine learning and pattern recognition:** much of of work
	involves teaching the computer about the user's activities or
	physical properties of objects and then acting on that information.
	I use techniques like dynamic time warping and support vector
	machines to accomplish these projects.
- **Computer graphics:** many of my projects involve manipulating
	models for 3D printing. Do you know algorithms for working with 3D
	graphics? Do you have experience with computational geometry? Does
	the phrase "pinhole camera model" mean anything to you?
- **Computer vision:** to create 3D models that work with objects in
	the real world, we need to understand the real world. Have you
	worked with depth cameras, object segmentation, or tracking?
- **HCI:** the basis of everything I do is a desire to improve
	people's experiences with technology. Can you design and conduct a
	user study, write a and administrer questionnaire, or interview
	people about their experiences? Can you work in grounded theory or
	ethnography?
- **Software development:** most, but not all, of my projects involve
	software development. Currently, our work involves some or all of
	Android, Arduino, iOS, Javascript, OpenGL, and Windows programming.

####Contacting Me
When you get ready to contact me, it will be very helpful for you
to do several things:

First, I'll want to know why you want to
work with me in particuar rather than any of the other fine faculty
at RIT. You can help by including this information in your email to
me. The more details the better! Rather than simply, "I like that
you do HCI," look through my [research and
publications](index.html#research) and see what work that I've done is
particulary appealing to you.

Another useful piece of information you can include when you contact
me is what kind of work you'd like to do&mdash;if you know; if you
don't, that's okay. For example, telling me that you are passionate
about programming, that you love interacting with people, or that
you enjoy nothing more than soldering can really help me to think
about how you might fit into the projects I have going.

Finally, if you have a resume, portfolio, or other examples of work
or experience, please go ahead and send them along. I
**strongly** prefer PDF format.

###Potential Capstone Students
Are you finishing up your Masters degree and you might like to do a
capstone project or a thesis with me? Read [the advice above for all
students](#all_students), then keep reading here.

My current policy is to only supervise capstone and thesis students
who are interested in working in an area directly related to my
research (see my [front page](index.html) for a description of my
interests). The reason for this is that I take a lot of time to work
with the students I supervise, so I want to be sure that I'll be able
to work with you effectively.

Do you already have an idea for a capstone project or thesis? If so,
make an appointment with me via email (following the advice for
contacting me [above](#all_students)) and we can talk about it.

Are you looking for an idea for a capstone or thesis? It would be
helpful if you take a class with me first so I have an idea of your
interests and skills, but it's not required. One way to approach
thinking about your final graduate work is to think about what kind
of job you want to get and what kinds of skills and knowledge will
help you to get that job. Go look at recruiting sites and find jobs
that make you feel excited. What kinds of skills would help you to
be an outstanding candidate for that job? If you can figure this
out, I can more effectively help you think about a project or
thesis.

**Please note:** I _do not_ accept capstone or thesis
students mid-semester! If you would like to work with me, I require
that your capstone proposal be _complete_ before the beginning
of the semester in which you will be doing the work.

###Potential PhD Students

Are you a current PhD student, or you'd like to be? Read [the advice
above for all students](#all_students), then keep reading here. 

If you're a current PhD student and you are thinking about switching
advisors, send me an email. Include the things above, but please
also give me some context about why you're interested in switching.

If you're thinking about applying to the PhD program at RIT, great!
Check out [my main page](index.html) which I will keep
updated with information about whether I'm currently recruiting PhD
students. If I am, please go ahead and contact me. In this case,
it's incredibly important to include as much context as you can, as
outlined above: why you want to work with me, what kind of work
you'd like to do, your previous experience and portfolio, and so on. 

Do note that I can't admit PhD students directly; however, you can
find more information and apply online at
[http://tinyurl.com/rit-phd](http://tinyurl.com/rit-phd) In your
application, be sure to note that you are interested in working with
me, and your application will be brought to my attention. Note that,
unlike some other programs, our PhD program admits students directly
to a professor; this is good in that it means you come in knowing who
you will work with, but the downside is that you don't have as much of
a chance to explore who you might be a good match with.
