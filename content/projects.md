Title: Projects

This is a list of project ideas. Most of them are half-formed and will
require a great deal of independent thinking and work from the
student, but also represent excellent learning opportunities.

Many of these projects deal with the idea of _augmented
fabrication_â€”the process of designing and fabricating new objects to
work with existing objects. You can read more about the basic idea in
[this short paper](/pubs/2016 Ashbrook-Towards Augmented
Fabrication.pdf), and more about some of the problems faced by novices
in [this longer paper](/pubs/2019 Mahapatra-Barriers to End-User Designers of Augmented Fabrication.pdf).

This list of projects is organized into rough categories, illustrating
the balance of software/hardware work involved.
