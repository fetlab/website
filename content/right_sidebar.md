###Prospective Students

I am often looking for undergraduate and graduate students interested
in improving human interaction with personal fabrication. Are you a
student interested in working with me? If so, please [read this
first](prospective_students.html).

###Potential Projects

Once you've read the above, you can look at this page of [potential
project ideas](projects.html) that I would like to have students work
on.

###Travel
I travel frequently. When I'm traveling, I may be more difficult than
usual to reach via email. Please see my [calendar](calendar.html) for
hints.
